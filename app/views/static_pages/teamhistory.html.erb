									WBI celebrated a decade of FIRSTÂ® Robotics tradition. Starting off the season at the Buckeye Regional in Cleveland, OH, team 461 won the Judge's Award for its support of other teams with both hardware and software and was seeded 13th at the end of qualification rounds. At the Boilermaker Regional, suffering from technical issues, the team was seeded 31st, but was selected by the second seed alliance of team 45, the Technokats, and team 234, Cyberblue. The alliance made it to the finals, being narrowly defeated in a tiebreaker match by a margin of three points. For its organization of alumni reunion, team 461 received a Judge's Award. At the FIRSTÂ® Championship event in Atlanta, GA, team 461 made a strong showing, going 6-1 and was seeded 10th at the end of qualification rounds.

WBI served as a mentor team this year to Teams 1555 at North White High School, Team Pulse, and 1646 at Lafayette Jefferson High School, Team Boiler Precision Guessworks. Our partnerships involved sending students and advisors to work with the teams at their schools as well as promoting the FIRSTÂ® experience. During 2005, WBI also assisted with the operation and setup of the Boilermaker Regional in West Lafayette, Indiana, as well as competing in it. At the Boilermaker Regional, WBI received the Website Design award. WBI also competed in the Motorola Midwest Regional, where the team won the Team Spirit Award for BOSS (Boiler Online Scouting System), an online database of scouting information on all of the teams at the regional. (Scouting data can be downloaded for the Boilermaker Regional, the Motorola Midwest Regional, and the Championship Event in Curie division can be found at http://www.thebluealliance.com/team/461/2005.)

We attended the Great Lakes Regional in Ypsilanti, Michigan, where WBI placed 22nd overall and was chosen by WildStang (#111), the first seed team, for the finals. WBI was awarded the Leadership in Control Award in honor of our programming efforts. At the Motorola Midwest Regional in Evanston, Illinois, we won the award for Website Design. We were also chosen as the first pick of sixth seed CFHS Robotics (#525) in elimination rounds. At the National Competition, the WBI alliance was 2nd overall in the Curie division, and 5th in the nation.

Funding improved and the team was able to attend the Motorola Midwest Regional and the National Championship. The team also went to several post-national competitions, the Indiana Robotics Invitational (IRI) and the Ford Sweet Repeat (FSR). The team took home the Daimler Chrysler Spirit Award from the Motorola Regional and the Teamwork Award from the IRI.

									In January of 2000, the team, Westside Boiler Invasion 461 (WBI 461), tackled the challenge of designing a robot. The robot was named Rowdy Pete 1, reflecting Purdue's great influence on WBI 461. In the first year, Westside Boiler Invasion was comprised of 18 high school students from West Lafayette and Harrison High Schools and 12 Purdue University students. The team was unique in the fact that it was completely student run. The team competed in the Motorola Midwest Regional, taking home the Rookie All-Star award. But the memories and hard work didn't stop there. At that time, the team did not have enough funds to buy uniforms (the team tie-dyed their own shirts, earning the nickname "Team Sherbet"), let alone attend the National Championship, which is the culminating event of the season. The advisors knew the great benefit of competing at nationals and did not want to let this opportunity pass by. Thus, everything possible was done to raise money: begging companies, getting donations from alumni, and even getting another team (Truck Town Terror #68, now called Truck Town Thunder) to pay for the hotel. The gracious professionalism paid to WBI 461 was immeasurable. All the effort put forth by the team paid off when Westside Boiler Invasion qualified for nationals at Motorola. Our team also set its precedent of being extremely spirited. Even though no awards were won at nationals, the fact that the team got there was enough to make it among the best experiences of everyone on the team.
