					<p class="card-text">
					WBI members participate year-round in FIRST® related activities, whether it be robot-building practice, website coding for team promotion, or outreach events to promote FIRST® robotics and STEM education. This helps to not only prepare students for FIRST® Robotics Competitions (FRC), but it also helps to familiarize team members with the principles of FIRST®.

<h4 class="card-title">What Is FIRST®</h4>
					<p class="card-text">
					In the words of FIRST® founder Dean Kamen, FIRST® was created "to transform our culture by creating a world where science and technology are celebrated and where young people dream of becoming science and technology heroes."
					</p>
					<p class="card-text">
					The mission of FIRST ® is to engage young people and inspire them to change the world. Through a wide range of opportunities and mentoring, participating students can enhance their technology skills, build self-confidence and leadership, learn to work as a team to achieve goals, and experience the excitement of FIRST® competition while making many new friends along the way.
					</p>
					<p class="card-text">
					FIRST® organizes several robotics competitions to get students involved in robotics through a fun game. The major competition is the FIRST® Robotics Competition, in which students build robots to play a given game on a human-sized field. FIRST® also organizes the FIRST® Tech Challenge, a game similar to FRC but smaller, and the FIRST® LEGO® League, a game where teams build robots out of LEGOs® to accomplish certain tasks.
